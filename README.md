## With our 3D Immersive Displays project, our goal is to create an easily accessible and immersive viewing experience using standard PC monitors, addressing the current lack of straightforward solutions for non-specialized hardware.
## To accomplish this task, we leverage a powerful combination of tools, including Blender for 3D realistic rendering and animation creation, OpenCV for image warping and processing, and Python for run-time video replay, along with various
## miscellaneous resources like color calibration, the display device creation, 3D alignment.

# Contribution
## Santiago :
## Video warping: Developed a python program that generates the monitors output.
## Video player: Developed a customized python program that plays three videos at the same time.

## Kevin : 

## User experience optimization: Focal points of interest for user.
## Blender immersive content creation: Set up of subjective environment.
## 3D Model crafting:  Correct models for environment.
## Device crafting: Set up of displays.

## Sebastian: WW
## User experience optimization: Create attraction for user-device product
## Blender immersive content creation: Model-scene modeling.	
## 3D Model crafting:  ⁠Detail representation of 3d objects.
## Device creation: ⁠Design and development of device set up.
