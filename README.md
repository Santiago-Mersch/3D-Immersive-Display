## Abstract

The 3D Immersive Displays project aims to provide an easily accessible and immersive viewing experience using standard PC monitors, addressing the current lack of straightforward solutions for non-specialized hardware. Leveraging a powerful combination of tools including Blender for 3D realistic rendering and animation creation, OpenCV for image warping and processing, and Python for run-time video replay, along with various miscellaneous resources like color calibration and display device creation, this project pushes the boundaries of immersive display technology.

## Contributions
### Santiago:
- Video Warping: Developed a Python program that generates output for monitors.
- Video Player: Developed a customized Python program that plays three videos simultaneously.

### Kevin:
- User Experience Optimization: Defined focal points of interest for users.
- Blender Immersive Content Creation: Set up subjective environment.
- 3D Model Crafting: Created accurate models for the environment.
- Device Crafting: Set up displays effectively.

### Sebastian:
- User Experience Optimization: Developed strategies to attract users to the product.
- Blender Immersive Content Creation: Created models for scenes.
- 3D Model Crafting: Detailed representation of 3D objects.
- Device Creation: Designed and developed the setup for devices.

## Awards
This project has been recognized with the **Outstanding Performance Award**.
